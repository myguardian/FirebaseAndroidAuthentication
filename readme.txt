this project is only need *json file copied to the proper folder
and recompiled

after that, project should produce the result :
- new user may be get registred;
- new user should be visible in Firestore console / Authentication / Users for admin;
- unfortuantely, the current version a bit limited : when user with the same e-mail try to login, it will not process as expected.
It should be fixed.
